			<h3>The Project</h3>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>The main project builds on a typical question for the Humanities "What is a house to you?" Although we are not always aware of, every person has a different connotation to such a simple word. What first seems like a very simple question, turns out to be quite complex to answer as everyone has their own take on the concept of a house. On the website the user is asked this question and also to choose from three images that represent their type of house. The next step is to confront the user with six different images that are a metaphor for concepts they would associate with when thinking of their type of house.</p>
				</div>
	
				<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>The user input is stored and according to the choice that is made of the type of house, a map of Europe is shown that displays what type of house users from European countries chose. After this step the images associated with the chosen type of house are connected to concepts that are searched for in the dataset the Dutch government has made public (openoverheid.org). A statistical table is presented with the choice correlated with the data from the dataset. The table actually shows the user how much working links, semi working links and broken links are found in the dataset the government has made public. In this way data is connected to a humanities question and in a way is a critical look at the dataset that is made public by the Dutch government.</p>

			<h3>The Course</h3>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>Coding the Humanities is a project that introduces students from the humanities faculty of the University of Amsterdam to the world of programming. During one month, every working day from nine to five, the students follow an intense course on HTML, CSS and Javascript. Experts from the industry give lectures and workshops on the basics of web development, programming, project management, databases and the students work in groups on collaborative projects.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>The group of students come from a variety of disciplines within the Humanities, such as Media Studies, European Studies and Philosophy. Heck, we even have some guy studying Musicology! They build a website using Polymer, a new library that allows developers to write their own custom HTML elements. The goal of the project was to learn how to program, so that they can make their own computational tools and rely less on specialists and specialist equipment for their own Humanities research. Everybody started out on different levels of coding skills, which was helpful for the more advanced students to teach and help the less advanced students and in return learn new things themselves. Not only was this project very educational, but it was also a lot of fun (and anguish and frustration, but that's part of writing code).</p>

			<h3>About Us</h3>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>A group of students from diverse disciplines within the UvA Humanities, we came together in the early days of june, a few with some coding skills, others absolute beginners, to follow the coding the humanities course. Little did we know! Four weeks later, after loads of coffee, conceptualization, frustration, collaboration, pizzas, drinks, polymer elements, java script workshops, presentations, grunt workshops, pitches, posters (this list could go on and on), this website you have landed on is our precious project. </p>
