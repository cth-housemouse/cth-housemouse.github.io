            <p>This website is a merge of two projects Coding the Humanities students worked on. The first project derived from the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02613539708455809#.U7UvqRZOZ4U">'Metaphor and Interdisciplinary analysis'</a> by Humanities scholar Christina Schaeffner, an article about metaphors in political discourse. The question 'What_does_house_mean_to_you?' is related to the 'Common European House Metaphor'; a misunderstanding between Gorbachev and his BRD counterpart Von Weizsäcker. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Gorbachev started a conversation with his colleague about Europe, comparing Europe to a house. His mental image of this house metaphor, however, was more of a Sovjet style apartment building in which every European country has its own apartment, whereas Von Weizsäcker's idea of a house resembled a family home more common in Germany, with a shared living room and multiple bedrooms. Consequently, the two state leaders had an interesting conversation with several misconceptions. The Common European House metaphor became part of the wider European political discourse, which it influenced greatly. 
            </p>

            <p>
            The second project is about the Open Data website of the Dutch government set up to oblige the <a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/">EU INSPIRE Directive</a>, that aims to "enable the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organisations and better facilitate public access to spatial information across Europe". The website of the Dutch government however, is not operating as it should. This is what we wanted to show in the second part. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Given the very limited amount of time available to work on the whole project, we decided to use static instead of dynamic data for the sake of concluding to a result. The numbers used are very optimistic though. Should one take a closer look on the actual dynamic data, they may come up with a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/Weyeser/status/439410248823357440">incosistencies and broken sets</a> which actually render the data inaccessible.
